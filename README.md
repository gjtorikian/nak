An `ack`/`ag` clone written in Node.js. The focus here is on speed and performance, 
rather than trying to 100% mimic all the functionality of `ack`.

There were two goals set out:

1. Be faster than `ack`
2. Return matches in order

I've benchmarked in numerous places where
and why code is written as it is, as well as possible areas of improvement. It's
mostly asynchronous, though due to the requirement of returning items in order,
performs a mergesort at the end of all the results obtained.

As long as it's faster than `ack`, I'm pleased.

# Behavior

A lot of the functionality is modeled around `ag`. In fact, you can provide an _.nakignore_ file to define patterns to ignore. _.nakignore_ files in the directory you're searching under are automatically included as ignore rules, but you can choose to specify an additional file with `-a`.

# Why?

After reading Felix's [Faster than C](https://github.com/felixge/faster-than-c) notes, I became inspired to just write a **fast** `ack` clone, in Node.js.

Previously, TJ had [written an `ack` clone in Node](https://github.com/visionmedia/search), but his code was not very performant. At least, it was slower than `ack`.

I benchmarked and rewrote and learned a lot. While `nak` does not support _everything_ `ack` does, it does nearly everything `ag` does, and, at least, 100% supports everything needed for Cloud9.

# Benchmarks

You like numbers? Me too. They're fun.

Here's the average time for grabbing the filelist in cloud9infra five times (about 33,761 files). The commands do the exact same thing by just listing all the available files in the directory structure, _and_ exclude the usual nonsense directories ( _.git_, _.c9revisions_, `sm` backups, _e.t.c._). :

`ag`     | `nak`    | `ack`    | `find`
---------|----------|----------|---------
10.052s  | 4.863s   | 5.217s   | 28.989s

Here are benchmarks for finding the phrase "va" in cloud9infra, as a whole-word regexp, case insensitively:

`ag`     | `nak`    | `ack`     | `grep`
---------|----------|-----------|---------
34.609s  | 29.327s  | 88.883s   | 256.14s

Obviously, part of the speed impediment to `ack` or `grep` is the lack of a _simple_ way to provide ignore rules. In addition, `ag` isn't really meant for a `find` replacement, which could explain the first table's results.

# Testing

All tests can be found in _tests_; they use [`mocha`](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) to run. Just call `mocha filelist` or `mocha search`.
