[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gjtorikian/nak.png)](https://travis-ci.org/gjtorikian/nak)

An `ack`/`ag` clone written in Node.js. The focus here is on speed and performance,
rather than trying to 100% mimic all the functionality of `ack`.

There were two goals set out:

1. Be faster than `ack`
2. Return matches in order

I've benchmarked in numerous places where
and why code is written as it is, as well as possible areas of improvement. It's
mostly asynchronous, though due to the requirement of returning items in order,
performs a mergesort at the end of all the results obtained.

As long as it's faster than `ack`, I'm pleased.

# Behavior

A lot of the functionality is modeled around `ag`. In fact, you can provide a _.nakignore_ 
file to define patterns to ignore. _.nakignore_ files in the directory you're searching 
under are automatically included as ignore rules, but you can choose to specify any 
additional file (with _.gitignore_-style rules) with `-a`.

Some missing options include specifying a maxdepth, or following symlinks.

# Usages

## As an executable

`nak -G '*.js' 'function' .`

Find all files ending in `js`, in the current directory, with the phrase `function`.

`nak -a ../.gitignore -i 'def' .`

Find all files in the current directory, with the phrase in `def` (case-insensitive), 
in the current directory; also, use the _.gitignore_ rules from the folder above

`nak -d '*.less' -w 'mixin' .`

Find all files in the current directory that are not `.less`, with the phrase `mixin` 
(whole word), in the current directory

## Within a script

```javascript
var nak = require("./lib/nak");

options = {};
options.list = true;
options.path = ".";

// capture stdout to do something with it
nak.run(options);
```

## Your own function event handlers - BETA

If you want, you can define some of your own function handling for certain events, 
and pass them to `nak`.
All functions should return `null` upon failing.

Currently available functions are:

* onFilepathSearchFn(filepath) - Given a `filepath`, this returns a String representing 
the contents of that file

If you're using `nak` as part of a Node.js script using `child_process.exec` or 
`child_process.spawn` you **MUST** serialize your function as JSON; `nak` will 
deserialize it for you. You must also store the function as `process.env.nak_<function_name>`. 
This is because `process.env` is automatically passed to the `exec` or `spawn` 
function. Modifying `process.env` like this only affects the running script, not your machine.

Behind the scenes, serialization occurs via the [simplefunc](https://github.com/ajlopez/SimpleFunc) module.

In the following examples, when `nak` encounters a filepath called `file1.txt`, 
it'll return "photo" as the file's contents. Otherwise, it returns `null`, and 
normal `nak` behavior is performed--in this case, a disk read of the file.

### Event functions in a script

```javascript
var simplefunc = require('simplefunc');

var fn = function(filepath) {
    if (/file1\.txt/.test(filepath)) return "photo";
    return null;
}

process.env.nak_onFilepathSearchFn = simplefunc.toJson(fn);

Exec(nakPath + " " + "-a .nakignore 'photo' " + process.cwd(), function(err, stdout, stderr) {
 // ...
}
```

### Event function from the command line

This is ugly, but it works the same as above:

```bash
nak -a .nakignore 'photo' --onFilepathSearchFn 'if (/file1\.txt/.test(filepath)) return "photo";\nreturn null;' .
```

# Why?

After reading Felix's [Faster than C](https://github.com/felixge/faster-than-c) notes, 
I became inspired to just write a **fast** `ack` clone, in Node.js.

I benchmarked and rewrote and learned a lot. While `nak` does not support _everything_ 
`ack` does, it does nearly everything `ag` does.

# Benchmarks

You like numbers? Me too. They're fun.

Here's the average time for grabbing information from a directory with 13,300 files 
five times. The commands do the exact same thing by just listing all the available 
files in the directory structure, _and_ try to exclude the same files/directories.

`ag`     | `nak`    | `ack`    | `find`
---------|----------|----------|---------
10.052s  | 4.863s   | 5.217s   | 28.989s

Here are benchmarks for finding the phrase "va" in cloud9infra, as a whole-word 
regexp, case insensitively:

`ag`     | `nak`    | `ack`     | `grep`
---------|----------|-----------|---------
34.609s  | 29.327s  | 88.883s   | 256.14s

Obviously, part of the speed impediment to `ack` or `grep` is the lack of a _simple_ 
way to provide ignore rules.

# Testing

All tests can be found in _tests_; they use [`mocha`](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) 
to run. To run them:

```
npm install mocha -g
npm test
```

# Builds

Building is necessary only if you want a minified version of nak, or, a version 
that works with [VFS-Local](https://github.com/c9/vfs-local).

Just call `node compile.js` from the root directory to generate a build. You'll 
need to `npm install uglify-js` first.

You'll get several files: one is nak minifed, and the other is a minified version 
of nak that is suitable for use with VFS. The API and argument consumption for VFS 
local is the exact same; just make sure you call `api.execute` within the callback 
for `vfs.extend`.

# Options

```
Options:
      -l|--list                             list files encountered
      -H|--hidden                           search hidden files and directories (default off)
      -c|--color                            adds color to results  (default off)
      -a|--pathToNakignore «value»          path to an additional nakignore file
      -q|--literal                          do not parse PATTERN as a regular expression; match it literally
      -w|--wordRegexp                       only match whole words
      -i|--ignoreCase                       match case insensitively
      -G|--fileSearch «value»               comma-separated list of wildcard files to only search on
      -d|--ignore «value»                   comma-separated list of wildcard files to additionally ignore
      -f|--follow                           follow symlinks (default off)
      -U|--addVCSIgnores                    include VCS ignore files (.gitignore); still uses .nakignore
         --ackmate                          output results in a format parseable by AckMate
         --onFilepathSearchFn «value»       while searching, executes this function on a matching filepath
```

# Hotspots

Right now there are two areas of the code that take the longest amount of time:

* determining whether a file is binary or not (calls to `isBinaryFile` in _walkdir.js_)
* assembling the final output in _finalizer_

Everything else--from ignore rule creation to option parsing--takes an insignificant 
amount of time to process.
